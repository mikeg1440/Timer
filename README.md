# Simple Countdown Timer

This is just a countdown timer that used as a way to test out how to deploy a pure React.js app using GitHub Pages.  

## Todo
- Fix the reset button after timer finishes without page refresh
- Allow setting timer with preset times using buttons (5, 10, 15)
- Create a break button that sets the timer for 5 minutes
